          <h2>Description</h2>
          <p>This first recipe isnt one. It is a philosophy, or a mindset of how I approach cooking. I learned this over the years of cooking for myself and others.
          <p>If you look at cooking every meal as a set of instructions to keep catalogued in your head, you can quickly get bored uninspired or discouraged. The goal of cooking is to make good food that you enjoy everyday. It is not 
                to be the best at following a set of instructions. Do not be afraid to be creative or change some ingredients when and if you cannot find them. </p>
          <p>In light of that, my advice is to learn how to cook the staples really well, then you learn how to mix the universal flavors. That is all that cooking is.
                Once you know this, you can mix and match anything you want without having to revert to google or youtube everytime you get hungry</p>
